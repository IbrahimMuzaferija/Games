## Introduction

The main object of this project is a JAVA application that implements tic-tac-toe game algorithm, along with Minimax and Apha-Beta pruning algorithms. 
Minimax is an algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two player turn based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgamon, Mancala, Chess, etc. 
Alphaâ€“Beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games.
